# Extensions

We always make extension of the core structure, even if you are not adding or removing anything.
This allows for future flexibility, whenever you copy/paste the input or output document, it might be exactly in sync with the core document on day 1, but maybe later on you want to add or remove fields which should be reflected everywhere.
